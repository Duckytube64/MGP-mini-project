# MGP-mini-project - Hydraulic erosion on terrain

This is an implementation of hydraulic erosion on terrain generated by heightmaps. 
The implementetion is based on [this paper](https://www.firespark.de/resources/downloads/implementation%20of%20a%20methode%20for%20hydraulic%20erosion.pdf) with some other adjustments.

The application can be started by just running the executable. 
In the menu there are parameters that can be set for the erosion simulation and then the simulation can be started by pressing the Start button.
